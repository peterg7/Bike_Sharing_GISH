# Bike Sharing

## Overview
New York City is a densily populated city with lots of traffic. Especially as a vistor to the city, it can be difficult to get around in a timely fashion. As an alternative to owning a mode of transportation or relying on public transit, Citi Bike is a bike sharing company with stations all over New York City. The idea is that this template could be applied to Des Moines, Iowa. In order to pitch the idea to investors, it is necessary to analyze data from the existing company, Citi Bike, to see how the company operates in the big city. From there, a proposal can be formulated with New York City as a sample case for starting a bike sharing company in Des Moines.

## Summary
To start off the analysis and get comfortable with the data, the total number of trips during August 2019, the proportion of short term customers to annual subscribers, and the peak riding hours were determined. Next, the geographical data was visualized by plotting the top starting and ending locations of riders. Finally, to get a sense of the mechanical stress of running a bike sharing company, the data was analyzed to show when bikes were due for repair and their individual utilization. 

## Challenge Overview
It's time to put together a story to tell potential investors. Using the previous analysis alongside new research, the goal is to convince investors that a bike sharing company in Des Moines is a prosperous buisiness idea.

This shows that based on demographics, there is a significant market for a bike sharing company in Des Moines.
