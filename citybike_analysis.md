# NYC Citi Biki Analysis

## Background
As a pitch to expand Citi Bike operations to Des Moines, here is a summary of the analysis performed on user data from New York City. 		

### Questions
The biggest question that needs to be answered is, does population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program? In order to address this question it is necessary to know the population in Des Moines and how it compares to NYC.

## Tableau Story 
Here is a breakdown of each story point in the Citi Bike Story.

### Point 1
NYC has about 40 times the population of Des Moines and 10 times the population density. There are more people and they are more densely packed. This data was collected from the US Census Bureau with the population data being accumulated July 1st, 2018 and the population density data from 2010. 

### Point 2
The two peak usage windows are 7am - 9am and 5pm - 7pm which correspond to commuter rush hours. This can be interpreted as most users are using the Citi Bike service as a form of transportation to and from work. These commuters make up the bulk of the subscription based users. The customer based users are most active during lunch and dinner hours, 11am - 9pm. 

### Point 3
When looking at the breakdown of users depending on the day, there is a clear trend for each user type. Subscribers are most active during the weekdays while short-term customers are using Citi Bike most heavily on the weekends. It's also worth noting that subscribers are traveling much shorter distances. Both of these points indicate that subscribers consist mainly of commuters who are traveling short distances on the weekdays. 

### Point 4
Going back to compare the two cities, the average commute time in Des Moines is about half that of New York City. It's also about a third the size of NYC meaning that Des Moines commuters travel less time and have a shorter distance to travel. 

### Point 5
Now, to tie everything together, Des Moines has a higher employment rate than NYC as of October 2019 with this data coming from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This tells the story that Des Moines has a higher employment density than NYC. According to the previous analysis, commuters are the primary market for Citi Bike. Des Moines has a higher density of commuters meaning there is a substantial consumer base for Citi Bike.
